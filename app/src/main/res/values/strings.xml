    <!--
    IMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR TRANSLATORS:

    1. TARGET AUDIENCE: Children aged 5-9 years old
    2. READING LEVEL: Simple words, short sentences
    3. TONE: Always positive, encouraging, never scary or demanding
    4. PURPOSE: This app encourages real-world gardening, not screen time
    5. EMOTIONAL CONNECTION: Plants are treated as friends/pets, not objects
    6. CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS: Gardening may have different cultural significance

    TECHNICAL NOTES:
    - %1$s, %2$s etc. are placeholders that will be replaced with plant names
    - \' represents an apostrophe in contractions (don't change to \")
    - All text should work on small phone screens
    - Consider that some languages are longer than English

    TONE GUIDELINES:
    - Use second person (you/your) to create personal connection
    - Avoid technical botanical terms
    - Use words that create emotional bonds (buddy, friend, companion)
    - Always frame plant care as positive, never as obligation
    - Celebrate small achievements enthusiastically
